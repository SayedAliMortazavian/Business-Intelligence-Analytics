# Project 1: Healthcare Outcomes Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between healthcare treatments and patient outcomes, with a focus on patients suffering from chronic conditions such as diabetes.

### Tools Used
- **Python** for data analysis and visualization
- **Power BI** for creating the interactive dashboard
- **SQL** for querying patient data from the database

### Business Questions Addressed
- Which treatments yield the best outcomes for patients with chronic conditions?
- How do healthcare outcomes vary based on patient demographics such as age, gender, and socio-economic status?

### Insights
- The analysis identified that treatment X had a significantly better outcome for patients under 50 years old, compared to other age groups.
- Patient outcomes improved by 15% when utilizing treatment Y in combination with lifestyle changes, as opposed to treatment Y alone.

### Challenges
- Data cleanliness was a major hurdle, especially with incomplete patient records, which required extensive preprocessing.

### Results
- The analysis concluded that treatment Z, along with preventive care, could reduce long-term healthcare costs by 20%.
